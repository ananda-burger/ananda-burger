# About me
Architect by profession, developer and artist by passion.

I am currently transitioning from Architecture to IT, looking for opportunities as back-end or front-end developer in an inclusive and healthy environment.

I believe technology can increase people's quality of life and I am excited to be a dev who can contribute to that.

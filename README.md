# :sparkles: About me
Architect by profession, developer and artist by passion.

I am currently transitioning from Architecture to IT, looking for opportunities as back-end or front-end developer in an inclusive and healthy environment.

I believe technology can increase people's quality of life and I am excited to be a dev who can contribute to that.

### My personal art gallery
 I am an artist on my spare time and I really love combining my dev skills with art. I truly believe art can make everything more beautiful and IT is no exception to that ;)

[Over here](https://ma-galerie.netlify.app/) you can check out the result of some of my **front-end studies creating my personal art gallery**.

Technologies used: React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Jest (unit tests).
